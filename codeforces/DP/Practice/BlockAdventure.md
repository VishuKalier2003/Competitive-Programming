## Problem Overview

In **Block Adventure**, you are given \( n \) columns of blocks, numbered from 1 to \( n \). The height of the \( i \)‑th column is \( h_i \). A character starts at the top of the first column with an initial bag containing \( m \) blocks. The character can perform three types of actions (as many times as desired):

1. **Remove a Block:**
   If the current column has at least one block, remove one block from the top and put it in the bag.

2. **Place a Block:**
   If the bag is not empty, remove one block from the bag and place it on the current column.

3. **Move to Next Column:**
   If \( i < n \) and \(|h_i - h_{i+1}| \leq k\) (where \( k \) is given), move to column \( i+1 \).

The character's goal is to reach the top of the \( n \)‑th column. However, when moving between columns, you may need to adjust heights by adding or removing blocks to meet the condition \(|h_i - h_{i+1}| \leq k\).

**Key point:**
For each move from column \( i \) to \( i+1 \), Gildong can effectively adjust the current column height to “prepare” for the move. The available budget of blocks is updated as:
\[
\text{currentBlocks} = \text{currentBlocks} + h_i - \max(0, h_{i+1} - k)
\]
If at any point the available blocks become negative, the move is impossible and the game cannot be won.

## Input and Output Format

**Input:**
- The first line contains an integer \( t \) (\(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)) — the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains three integers \( n \) (\(1 \le n \le 100\)), \( m \) (\(0 \le m \le 10^6\)), and \( k \) (\(0 \le k \le 10^6\)).
  - The second line contains \( n \) integers \( h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n \) (\(0 \le h_i \le 10^6\)), which represent the initial heights of the columns. The array always contains a valid configuration.

**Output:**
- For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to reach the \( n \)‑th column using the allowed operations under the given constraints; otherwise, print "NO". (Case-insensitive)

---

## Example

**Input:**
```
5
3 0 1
4 3 5
3 1 2
1 4 7
4 10 0
10 20 10 20
2 5 5
0 11
1 9 9
99
```

**Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- **Test Case 1:**
  Start with 0 blocks in the bag at column 1 (height 4).
  - Remove 0 blocks → \( h_1 = 4 \).
  - For move from column 1 (height 4) to column 2 (height 3):
    \(\text{requiredHeight} = \max(0, 3 - 1) = 2\).
    Update bag: \( 0 + 4 - 2 = 2 \).
  - Move to column 2; now use the available blocks to adjust further as needed.
  Ultimately, it's possible to reach column 3 with non-negative blocks, so answer is "YES".

- Other test cases follow similar reasoning.

---

## Approach and Intuition

1. **Iterative Simulation:**
   - Start at column 1 with \( m \) blocks.
   - For each column \( i \) (from 1 to \( n-1 \)):
     - Calculate the minimum height required at column \( i \) to safely move to column \( i+1 \) as:
       \[
       \text{requiredHeight} = \max(0, h_{i+1} - k)
       \]
     - Update the available blocks:
       \[
       \text{currentBlocks} = \text{currentBlocks} + h_i - \text{requiredHeight}
       \]
     - If \(\text{currentBlocks} < 0\) at any step, the move is impossible, and the answer is "NO".

2. **Greedy Resource Management:**
   - The idea is to use extra blocks from the current column to offset the deficit needed to meet the required height of the next column.
   - Always take advantage of any surplus blocks available from the current column.

3. **Final Decision:**
   - If the simulation completes (i.e., the available blocks never become negative) until the \( n \)‑th column, then Gildong can win the game, so output "YES".

## Core Concepts and Their Applications

1. **Greedy Resource Management:**
   - **Concept:** Use surplus resources (blocks) from one column to offset deficits in the next column.
   - **Usage:** Here, we update the number of blocks available by adding the current column's blocks and subtracting the required number for the next move.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Water Tank or Battery Problems:** Where you manage a resource (water, energy) over intervals.
     - **Budgeted Path Problems:** Where you must ensure a resource remains non-negative while traversing a path.

2. **Prefix Summation/Running Totals:**
   - **Concept:** Maintaining a running total (in this case, current blocks) to make decisions at each step.
   - **Usage:** The solution iteratively updates the bag count as you move through the columns.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Subarray Sum Problems:** Using running totals to determine feasibility.
     - **Dynamic Programming with Running Totals:** Such as problems on resource allocation along a path.

3. **Simulation:**
   - **Concept:** Directly simulate the process (column by column) to determine if the final condition (non-negative blocks) is maintained.
   - **Usage:** The solution directly simulates each move, updating the available blocks.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Game Simulation Problems:** Simulating moves in games with resource management.
     - **Path Traversal Problems:** Where you simulate movement and resource consumption.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The algorithm processes each column once, so the time complexity is \( O(n) \) per test case.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - \( O(n) \) is used to store the column heights, and a few additional variables are used, so overall space complexity is \( O(n) \).

Given \( n \leq 100 \) per test case, this solution is highly efficient.

## Final Summary

- **Problem Statement:**
  Given \( n \) columns with heights \( h_i \), an initial bag with \( m \) blocks, and an allowed height difference \( k \), determine if it is possible to move from the first column to the \( n \)‑th column. You can remove or add blocks on a column, but you can only move to the next column if the difference in heights is at most \( k \). Determine if the game can be won ("YES") or not ("NO").

- **Approach:**
  - Simulate the journey from column 1 to column \( n \) by maintaining a running total of blocks.
  - For each move, calculate the required minimum blocks based on the next column's height and allowed difference \( k \).
  - Update the bag count accordingly and check if it ever becomes negative.

  - Greedy resource management using a running total.
  - Direct simulation of the process.
  - Maintaining prefix sums (running totals) to ensure feasibility.
