## Problem Overview

You are given a number \( n \) (as a string) of length at most \(10^5\). You may perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose one digit of \( n \), square it, and replace that digit with the result.
  **Constraint:** The squared value must be a single digit (i.e. if you choose digit \( x \), then \( x^2 < 10 \)).

The allowed squarings are:
- \(0^2 = 0\)
- \(1^2 = 1\)
- \(2^2 = 4\)
- \(3^2 = 9\)

Digits 4 through 9 cannot be replaced because their square is at least 16.

The task is to decide whether it is possible to obtain a number divisible by 9 via these operations. In other words, can you modify some of the 2's and 3's (since those are the only digits that change) such that the sum of the digits becomes divisible by 9?

---

## Input and Output Format

**Input:**
- The first line contains an integer \( t \) (\(1 \le t \le 10^4\)) — the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing the number \( n \) (given as a string without leading zeros; its length is at most \(10^5\)).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the numbers across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

**Output:**
- For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to obtain a number divisible by 9 by performing the operations, and "NO" otherwise.
- The answer is case-insensitive.

---

## Example

**Input:**
```
9
123
322
333333333333
9997
5472778912773
1234567890
23
33
52254522632
```

**Output:**
```
NO
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
NO
YES
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- In the first example, the possible outcomes from 123 are limited (e.g., 123, 143, 129, 149), and none are divisible by 9.
- In the second example, replacing the second digit (2) with \(2^2 = 4\) transforms the number to 342, which is divisible by 9.

---

## Approach and Intuition

1. **Initial Sum Check:**
   Calculate the sum of the digits. If the sum is already divisible by 9, then answer is "YES".

2. **Only Operable Digits:**
   The only digits you can change are 2 and 3 (since \(2^2 = 4\) and \(3^2 = 9\)), and these operations change the digit sums by:
   - Flipping a **2**: increases the sum by \(4 - 2 = 2\).
   - Flipping a **3**: increases the sum by \(9 - 3 = 6\).

3. **Brute Force over Limited Changes:**
   Count the occurrences of digit '2' and '3'. Since you can only increase the sum, try all combinations of flipping up to \(\min(\text{count}, 8)\) occurrences of 2's and 3's. The limit 8 is enough because any change modulo 9 will repeat after at most 9 changes.

4. **Check Divisibility:**
   For each possible number of flips for 2's and 3's, check if \( \text{original sum} + 2 \times (\text{flips of 2}) + 6 \times (\text{flips of 3}) \) is divisible by 9. If yes for any combination, output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

## Core Concepts and Their Applications

1. **MEX / Digit Sum & Divisibility:**
   - **Concept:** The divisibility of a number by 9 is determined by the sum of its digits.
   - **Usage:** In this problem, you want to adjust the digit sum by performing allowed operations (squaring digits 2 and 3) so that the final sum is divisible by 9.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Divisibility Problems:** Problems where you adjust digits to satisfy divisibility (e.g., making a number divisible by 3 or 9).
     - **Digit Manipulation:** Tasks that involve changing digits to achieve a desired property.

2. **Brute Force over Limited Options:**
   - **Concept:** Although \( k \) can be large, only a small subset of digits (2 and 3) are eligible for change, and the maximum number of changes needed is bounded (e.g., 8).
   - **Usage:** The solution iterates over all possible numbers of flips for '2' and '3' up to a small constant.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Limited State DP/Brute Force:** Problems where even though the search space is large, the number of effective choices is limited.

3. **Greedy Adjustment via Operations:**
   - **Concept:** Adjusting the digit sum minimally to achieve divisibility by 9.
   - **Usage:** Testing all combinations of flipping a limited number of eligible digits.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Optimization Problems:** Problems where you have to perform minimal operations to change a property (e.g., changing characters to make a string palindrome).

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Calculating the digit sum and counts: \( O(\text{length of } n) \).
  - Brute forcing over possible flips: Constant iterations (at most \( 9 \times 9 = 81 \) iterations).

  Overall: \( O(\text{length of } n) \) per test case.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - \( O(1) \) additional space besides the input.

## Problem Rating: 78/100

**Detailed Score Explanation:**

- **Concept Reusability (20/25):**
  Adjusting digit sums for divisibility is a common idea in number manipulation problems. Although the specific allowed operations are unique, the underlying concept is widely applicable.

- **Technique Similarity (18/25):**
  Brute force over a small number of choices and using digit sum properties are common techniques. These methods appear in many competitive programming and interview problems related to number properties.

- **Difficulty (20/25):**
  The problem is moderately challenging. Recognizing that only digits 2 and 3 can change and that you only need to consider a bounded number of changes is key.

- **Interview/Assessment Potential (20/25):**
  This problem tests knowledge of divisibility rules, digit manipulation, and bounded brute force—a combination that is quite common in technical assessments and competitive programming interviews.

---

## Final Summary

- **Problem Statement:**
  Given a number \( n \) (as a string), determine if you can obtain a number divisible by 9 by repeatedly replacing a digit with its square (allowed only if the squared result is a digit, which restricts operations to digits 2 and 3).

- **Approach:**
  - Compute the sum of digits.
  - If the sum is divisible by 9, answer is "YES".
  - Otherwise, count occurrences of 2 and 3, and simulate all combinations (up to 8 changes each) to see if the adjusted sum becomes divisible by 9.

- **Key Techniques:**
  - Using digit sum properties to check divisibility by 9.
  - Limited brute force over eligible operations.
  - Greedy adjustment and combinatorial checking.

- **Complexity:**
  - Time: \( O(\text{length of } n) \) per test case.
  - Space: \( O(1) \).

- **Problem Rating:** **78/100**
  - **Concept Reusability:** 20/25
