Below is the comprehensive summary file for the **Julya Calendar** problem. In the later sections, you'll find an explanation of the key concepts used in the solution along with examples of similar problems where these concepts apply.

## Problem Overview

You are given a non-negative integer \( n \) (the "magic number"). The task is to reduce \( n \) to 0 by repeatedly subtracting one of its digits (the digit must appear in \( n \)). The goal is to find the **minimum number of subtractions** required.

For example, for \( n = 24 \), one optimal sequence is:
- \( 24 \rightarrow 20 \) (subtract 4)
- \( 20 \rightarrow 18 \) (subtract 2)
- \( 18 \rightarrow 10 \) (subtract 8)
- \( 10 \rightarrow 9 \)  (subtract 1)
- \( 9 \rightarrow 0 \)   (subtract 9)

This sequence takes 5 operations.

## Approach and Intuition

We solve the problem using **dynamic programming (DP)** combined with **recursion** and **memoization**. The idea is to compute, for any given number \( n \), the minimum number of steps needed to reduce it to 0 by subtracting one of its nonzero digits.

- **Base Case:**
  If \( n = 0 \), return 0 (no operations are needed).

- **Recursive Case:**
  For \( n > 0 \), try subtracting each nonzero digit \( d \) present in \( n \). Then,
  \[
  dp[n] = 1 + \min\{ dp[n-d] \}
  \]

- **Memoization:**
  Store the result for each \( n \) in a DP array (or vector) to avoid re-computation.

#include <iostream>     // For input and output
#include <vector>       // For vector operations
#include <limits>       // For numeric_limits
using namespace std;
#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);

// Recursive helper function that returns the minimum number of subtractions
// needed to reduce 'num' to 0, using memoization stored in 'dp'.
int helper(int num, vector<int>& dp) {
    if(num == 0)        // Base case: if num is 0, no operations are needed.
        return 0;
    if(dp[num] != numeric_limits<int>::max())  // Return if already computed.
        return dp[num];

    int temp = num, ans = numeric_limits<int>::max();
    // Iterate through each digit of 'num'.
    while(temp != 0) {
        int digit = temp % 10;  // Extract the last digit.
        if(digit > 0)
            // For each nonzero digit, compute minimum steps for (num - digit) plus one operation.
            ans = min(ans, helper(num - digit, dp) + 1);
        temp /= 10;  // Remove the last digit.
    }
    dp[num] = ans;  // Store the computed result in dp.
    return dp[num];
}

int main() {
    fast;
    int num;
    cin >> num;  // Read the magic number.
    vector<int> dp(num+1, numeric_limits<int>::max());  // DP vector, initialize with max int.
    cout << helper(num, dp) << "\n";  // Print the minimum number of subtractions.
    return 0;

## Core Concepts and Their Applications

### **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**
- **Concept:** Break the problem into overlapping subproblems and store (memoize) their solutions.
- **Usage in This Problem:**
  \( dp[n] \) stores the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce \( n \) to 0.
- **Similar Problems:**
  - **Coin Change Problem:** Compute the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount.
  - **Minimum Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero (LeetCode):** A problem where you reduce a number using allowed operations.
  - **Subtraction Game Problems:** Often seen in Codeforces/CodeChef where you subtract allowed numbers to reach zero.

### **Recursion**
- **Concept:** Solve a problem by reducing it into smaller instances of the same problem.
- **Usage in This Problem:**
  The function recursively subtracts a digit and computes the minimum steps.
- **Similar Problems:**
  - **Recursive Digit DP:** Counting or optimization problems where you process each digit (e.g., counting numbers with certain properties).
  - **Backtracking/DFS on Number Transformations:** Problems that require exploring all possible transformations (e.g., "Reduce a Number to Zero").

### **Digit Dynamic Programming (Digit DP)**
- **Concept:** A specialized form of DP that processes a number digit by digit.
- **Usage in This Problem:**
  The solution iterates through all digits of \( n \) and considers each nonzero digit for subtraction.
- **Similar Problems:**
  - **Counting Numbers with Constraints:** For example, problems that ask for the number of valid numbers within a range with certain digit properties.
  - **Digit Sum Problems:** Where you need to optimize or count based on the sum of digits.
  - **"Digit DP" Classic Problems:** Such as those found on Codeforces or SPOJ that require manipulation of digits.

---

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  In the worst-case scenario, every number from \( n \) down to 0 might be computed once. For each number, we process its digits (up to about 19 for \( n \le 10^{18} \)). With memoization, many redundant computations are avoided.
- **Space Complexity:**
  The DP array (or vector) requires \( O(n) \) space. For extremely large \( n \) (e.g., \( 10^{18} \)), a more space-efficient structure like a hash map would be necessary, but the given solution handles smaller constraints.

## Final Summary

- **Problem Statement:**
  Reduce a magic number \( n \) to 0 by subtracting one of its nonzero digits at each step. Compute the minimum number of subtractions needed.
