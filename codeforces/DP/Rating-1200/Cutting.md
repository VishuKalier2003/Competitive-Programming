## Problem Overview

You are given a sequence of \( n \) integers that contains an equal number of even and odd numbers. You have a budget of \( B \) bitcoins and you may make cuts between adjacent elements. A cut splits the sequence into contiguous segments. The constraint is that **each resulting segment must have an equal number of even and odd integers**.

Each potential cut between two adjacent elements has a cost equal to the absolute difference of these two numbers. Your goal is to maximize the number of cuts you can make without exceeding your bitcoin budget.

**Example:**
For the sequence \([1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20]\) with \(B = 4\), the optimal solution is to cut between 2 and 5 (cost \(|2-5|=3\)), resulting in 1 cut.

---

## Input and Output Format

**Input:**
- The first line contains two integers \( n \) (\(2 \le n \le 100\)) and \( B \) (\(1 \le B \le 100\)) — the number of elements in the sequence and the budget in bitcoins.
- The second line contains \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) (\(1 \le a_i \le 100\)), and the sequence has an equal number of even and odd numbers.

**Output:**
- Print a single integer — the maximum number of cuts that can be made while spending no more than \( B \) bitcoins.

---

## Approach and Intuition

1. **Valid Cut Criteria:**
   A cut between positions \(i-1\) and \(i\) is valid if the segment ending at position \(i-1\) has an equal number of even and odd numbers.

2. **Collecting Cut Costs:**
   As you traverse the array, maintain counts for evens and odds. Every time these counts become equal (and nonzero), mark the cost of a potential cut (i.e. \(|a_i - a_{i-1}|\)).

3. **Optimizing Within Budget:**
   To maximize the number of cuts, choose the cuts with the smallest cost first. Sort the potential cut costs (or use a min-heap) and then select as many as possible while the cumulative cost does not exceed \( B \).

## Core Concepts and Their Applications

1. **Greedy Selection via Priority Queues:**
   - **Concept:** When given multiple potential operations with costs, a priority queue (min-heap) is used to select the cheapest operations first.
   - **Usage in This Problem:**
     - We store potential cut costs in a min-heap and then pick the smallest costs until the budget is exhausted.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal’s Algorithm):** Uses a similar greedy selection process.
     - **Task Scheduling Problems:** Where tasks with the smallest cost or time are selected first.

2. **Prefix Segmentation and Counting:**
   - **Concept:** Maintain counts (e.g., even and odd numbers) as you traverse an array to identify valid split points.
   - **Usage in This Problem:**
     - We keep running counts of even and odd numbers. When they are equal (and nonzero), a cut can be made.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Balanced Subarray Problems:** Finding subarrays with equal numbers of two types of elements (e.g., 0s and 1s).
     - **Partition Problems:** Where you need to split arrays based on balanced properties.

3. **Budget Optimization:**
   - **Concept:** Maximizing the number of operations (cuts) under a budget constraint.
   - **Usage in This Problem:**
     - Sum the cost of selected cuts and ensure it does not exceed the budget.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Knapsack Problems:** Choosing items with minimal cost to maximize the count or value under a budget.
     - **Resource Allocation Problems:** Distributing limited resources optimally.

---

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  - **Iteration over Array:** \( O(n) \).
  - **Priority Queue Operations:** In the worst-case, \( O(n \log n) \) (each potential cut is inserted and then removed).

  Overall per test case: \( O(n \log n) \).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - \( O(n) \) for storing the input and the min-heap in the worst-case.

  The problem utilizes greedy selection, array segmentation, and resource allocation concepts that are widely applicable in many scenarios (e.g., task scheduling, balanced partitions).

- **Technique Similarity (20/25):**
  Using priority queues to select the minimum cost operations and maintaining prefix counts are standard techniques found in competitive programming and technical interviews.

- **Difficulty (20/25):**
  The problem is moderately challenging. The key insight is to recognize the valid cut positions and then optimize cut selection under a budget constraint.

- **Interview/Assessment Potential (20/25):**
  The concepts of greedy algorithms under budget constraints and balanced subarray segmentation are common in technical interviews, making this a solid problem to practice and discuss.

## Final Summary

- **Problem Statement:**
  Given a sequence of integers (with equal numbers of even and odd elements) and a budget \( B \) in bitcoins, find the maximum number of cuts you can make such that each segment has an equal number of even and odd numbers. The cost of a cut is the absolute difference between the adjacent elements where the cut is made.

- **Approach:**
  - Traverse the sequence while maintaining running counts of even and odd numbers.
  - Each time these counts are equal and nonzero, record the cost of a potential cut.
  - Use a min-heap to select the cheapest cuts until the budget is exhausted.

- **Key Techniques:**
  - Greedy selection using priority queues.
  - Prefix segmentation with even/odd counting.
  - Budget-constrained optimization.

- **Complexity:**
  - Time: \( O(n \log n) \) per test case.
  - Space: \( O(n) \).
