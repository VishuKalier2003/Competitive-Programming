### **Problem Overview**

Monocarp had a **Regular Bracket Sequence (RBS)** of even length \( n \). Some characters were lost due to data corruption, leaving the odd-positioned characters replaced by `_` and the even-positioned characters remaining intact. The task is to restore the RBS by replacing `_` with brackets in a way that minimizes the **cost** of the sequence. The **cost** is defined as the sum of the distances between paired brackets.

### **Cost Calculation Example**

For a sequence like **(())()**, the pairs are:
1. `(__)__` → Distance = \( 4 - 1 = 3 \)
2. `_()___` → Distance = \( 3 - 2 = 1 \)
3. `____()` → Distance = \( 6 - 5 = 1 \)

Thus, the **total cost** = \( 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \).

### **Input and Output**

#### **Input Format**
- \( t \) (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - \( n \) (even length of the string)
  - String \( s \) of length \( n \), where all **odd-positioned characters** are `_`, and even positions contain `(` or `)`.

#### **Output Format**
For each test case, output the **minimum cost** of the restored RBS.

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Input**
```
4
6
_(_)_)
2
_)
8
_)_)_)_)
8
_(_)_(_)
```

#### **Output**
```
5
1
4
8
```

#### **Explanation**
1. The first test case (`_(_)_)`) can be restored to `(())()`, which has a **cost of 5**.
2. The second test case (`_)`) can only be `()`, which has **cost 1**.
3. The third test case (`_)_)_)_)`) can only be `()()()()`, which has **cost 4**.
4. The fourth test case (`_(_)_(_)`) can be ` (())(())`, with **cost 8**.

    // Fast input reader class for handling large input sizes efficiently.

                    balance++;  // Opening bracket increases balance
                }
            }
            // Odd-indexed positions must be filled with the optimal bracket choice
            else {
                if(balance > 0) {
                    completeString.append(')');  // Insert closing bracket if balance is positive
                    balance--;  // Decrease balance as we've closed a bracket
                } else {
                    completeString.append('(');  // Otherwise insert opening bracket
                    balance++;  // Increase balance as we've opened a bracket

### **Breakdown of Approach**

1. **Restoring the RBS (`minCost` function)**
   - Traverse through the string:
     - If the position **is even**, the character is **already present**.
     - If the position **is odd**, insert a bracket `(` or `)` **optimally** based on the current **balance**:
       - If balance is positive (more `(` encountered), insert `)`.
       - Otherwise, insert `(`.

2. **Calculating the Cost (`findCost` function)**
   - Track the **indices of opening and closing brackets** separately.
   - Compute the total cost as **sum of closing bracket indices minus sum of opening bracket indices**.

---

### **Where Else Can We Apply This?**

1. **Expression Validation & Parentheses Matching**
   - This approach can be adapted to **validate mathematical expressions** with brackets (e.g., `((3+5)*2)`).
   - **Stack-based or balance-based methods** are used to ensure that opening brackets are matched with the correct closing brackets.

2. **Bracket Sequence Correction**
   - Similar logic is useful when **fixing invalid sequences** in programming languages (e.g., `((())` needs a closing `)`).

3. **Code Parsing and Compiler Design**
   - In **compiler design**, such logic can be used to **parse and validate syntax trees**.
   - For example, **abstract syntax trees (ASTs)** are built by parsing expressions that require matching parentheses.

4. **Mathematical Expression Evaluation**
   - Problems involving infix-to-postfix conversions, like evaluating expressions with nested operations, use a similar idea of **balanced parentheses**.
   - **Shunting-yard algorithm** is used in **expression parsing**, which involves handling nested expressions like `((3+5)*2)`.

5. **Dynamic Programming Problems Involving Nested Structures**
   - Similar balance-based problems show up in **Dynamic Programming** (DP) when working with nested structures, like calculating the **optimal cost** in sequence alignment or string edit problems.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

- **Restoring the sequence**: We iterate through the string once (O(n)) and adjust balance for each bracket, which is done in constant time.
- **Cost calculation**: We iterate through the string a second time to compute the sum of indices, which is O(n).

Thus, for each test case:
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string. For \( t \) test cases, the overall complexity is \( O(t \times n) \).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - We store the string for each test case, which is \( O(n) \).
  - The `StringBuilder` for restoring the sequence also takes \( O(n) \).

Thus, the **space complexity** is \( O(n) \).

### **Conclusion**

- **DSA Concepts Covered**:
  - **Balance counting** (for parentheses matching).
  - **Greedy strategies** to minimize cost.
  - **String processing** and optimal modifications.

- These concepts are highly applicable in problems such as:
  - Parentheses validation.
  - Syntax checking in compilers.
  - Dynamic programming problems involving nested structures.
  - Expression evaluation and parsing.

By practicing these concepts, you can handle a wide variety of problems in **competitive programming**, **algorithm design**, and **compiler construction**.
