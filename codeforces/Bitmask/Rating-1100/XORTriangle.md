## Problem Overview

You are given an integer \(x\) (\(x \ge 2\)). Your task is to determine if there exists a positive integer \(y\) (\(1 \le y < x\)) such that the three side lengths:

- \(x\)
- \(y\)
- \(x \oplus y\) (bitwise XOR of \(x\) and \(y\))

can form a non-degenerate triangle. A triangle with side lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is non-degenerate if it satisfies the triangle inequalities:
- \(a + b > c\)
- \(a + c > b\)
- \(b + c > a\)

If there exists such a \(y\), output any valid \(y\); otherwise, output \(-1\).

---

## Input and Output

#### **Input Format**
- The first line contains an integer \(t\) â€” the number of test cases.
- For each test case, there is a single integer \(x\) (\(2 \le x \le 10^9\)).

#### **Output Format**
- For each test case, print one integer on a separate line:
  - A valid \(y\) (with \(1 \le y < x\)) if one exists.
  - Otherwise, print \(-1\).

#### **Example**

**Input:**
```
7
5
2
6
3
69
4
420
```

**Output:**
```
3
-1
5
-1
66
-1
320
```

*Explanation:*
- In the first test case, \(x = 5\) and one valid answer is \(y = 3\). Note that \(3 \oplus 5 = 6\) and the sides \(3\), \(5\), \(6\) form a non-degenerate triangle.
- In some cases, like \(x = 2\) or \(x = 3\), no valid \(y\) exists that can form such a triangle, hence the answer is \(-1\).

## Detailed Discussion and DSA Concepts

### **Core Concepts:**

1. **Bit Manipulation:**
   - **Understanding Binary Representations:**
     The solution leverages bitwise operations. The expression `Long.highestOneBit(num)` returns the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \(x\), and shifting it left and subtracting 1 gives a mask with all bits set up to that position.
   - **Creating and Using Masks:**
     The mask \((\text{highestOneBit}(x) << 1) - 1\) is used to create a number with all bits set within the range of \(x\). This is then used to determine which bits are off in \(x\) using XOR (`mask ^ x`).
   - **Bitwise OR and XOR:**
     The final candidate for \(y\) is formed by OR-ing a bit that is on in \(x\) (using `Long.lowestOneBit(num)`) with the bits that are off (from `mask ^ num`). This combination is critical to ensure the triangle inequality holds.

2. **Triangle Inequality:**
   - **Non-degenerate Triangle Condition:**
     For three side lengths to form a valid (non-degenerate) triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequalities. The solution is designed so that with the chosen \(y\), the sides \(x\), \(y\), and \(x \oplus y\) satisfy these conditions.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - **Handling Powers of Two and All-Ones Numbers:**
     If \(x\) is a power of 2 or \(x\) has all bits set (e.g., \(x = 3, 7, 15, \ldots\)), it is proven that no valid \(y\) exists, and the answer is \(-1\).

## **Where Else Can We Apply This Logic and These Concepts?**

1. **Bit Manipulation Problems:**
   - **Optimization and Masking:**
     The technique of creating masks and manipulating bits is common in problems that involve subsets, permissions, and flags. Problems that require checking or modifying specific bits in an integer are a frequent theme in competitive programming.
   - **Subset XOR Problems:**
     This concept is useful in problems where you need to find subsets with a particular XOR property, often seen in dynamic programming with bitmasking.

2. **Geometry and Triangle Conditions:**
   - **Triangle Formation Conditions:**
     The triangle inequality is a standard condition in many geometry problems. Understanding how to manipulate numerical properties to satisfy these conditions can be applied to a wide range of computational geometry problems.

3. **Algorithmic Problem Solving:**
   - **Edge Case Analysis:**
     The careful handling of edge cases (like powers of two or all-ones numbers) teaches you to always consider special conditions in problems, a vital skill in competitive programming.
   - **Combining Different Techniques:**
     This problem combines bit manipulation with geometric properties. Such interdisciplinary approaches are common in advanced algorithm problems where multiple strategies must be merged.

4. **Cryptography:**
   - **XOR Operations:**
     XOR is a fundamental operation in cryptography. Understanding its properties and how to manipulate bits efficiently can be directly applicable to designing and analyzing encryption algorithms.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The main loop processes each test case in \(O(1)\) time since all operations (bit shifting, XOR, OR) are constant time operations.
  - Given \(t\) test cases, the overall time complexity is \(O(t)\).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of additional space (a few long variables and a StringBuilder for output).
  - Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

---

## Final Summary

- **Problem Statement:**
  Determine if there exists a \(y\) (\(1 \le y < x\)) such that \(x\), \(y\), and \(x \oplus y\) can form a non-degenerate triangle. If such a \(y\) exists, output it; otherwise, output \(-1\).

- **Key Ideas and Techniques:**
  - **Bit Manipulation:** Creating masks, extracting set bits, and combining bits using OR and XOR.
  - **Triangle Inequality:** Ensuring that the chosen values form a valid triangle.
  - **Edge Case Handling:** Returning \(-1\) for powers of two or numbers with all bits set.

- **DSA Concepts Covered:**
  - Bit-level operations and mask creation.
  - Logical conditions for geometric validity (triangle inequalities).
  - Efficient edge case analysis.

- **Where Else to Apply:**
  - Problems involving subset XOR and bitmask dynamic programming.
  - Geometric problems requiring verification of triangle inequalities.
  - Cryptographic algorithms utilizing XOR and bit-level manipulations.
  - General optimization problems where combining multiple techniques is required.

- **Complexity:**
  The solution runs in \(O(t)\) time with \(O(1)\) space complexity.
