## Problem Overview

You are given two integers \(l\) and \(r\) (\(1 \le l \le r \le 10^7\)). Your task is to find two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that:

- \(l \leq a+b \leq r\)
- \(\gcd(a,b) \neq 1\) (i.e. \(a\) and \(b\) are not coprime)

If such \(a\) and \(b\) exist, output any valid pair; otherwise, output \(-1\).

**Example:**
For \(l = 11\) and \(r = 15\), one valid answer is \(a = 6\) and \(b = 9\) because \(6+9=15\) and \(\gcd(6,9)=3\).

---

## Approach and Intuition

1. **Observations:**
   - When \(r \leq 3\), it is impossible to find any valid pair.
   - If \(l = r\), the sum \(a+b\) is fixed, so we must check if this fixed sum is composite. If it is composite, we can split it into two numbers with a common factor.
   - If \(l < r\), we have flexibility. One simple construction is to choose two equal even numbers. Two equal even numbers guarantee \(\gcd(a,b) \geq 2\).

2. **Strategy:**
   - **Case 1 (\(l = r\)):**
     - Check if \(l\) is composite by testing factors from 2 to \(\sqrt{l}\).
     - If a factor is found, output a valid pair such as \((l-i, i)\) (where \(i\) is a factor) so that \((l-i)+i=l\).
     - If \(l\) is prime, output \(-1\).
   - **Case 2 (\(l < r\)):**
     - Find the largest even number \(\leq r\).
     - Split that even number evenly: let \(a = \text{largestEven}/2\) and \(b = \text{largestEven}/2\).

3. **Edge Case:**
   - If \(r \le 3\), output \(-1\) since it's impossible to form a valid pair.

## Core Concepts and Their Applications

1. **GCD and Composite Numbers:**
   - **Concept:** Two numbers share a nontrivial common factor (gcd \(\neq 1\)) if they are both divisible by some number greater than 1.
   - **Usage in This Problem:**
     - Ensuring non-coprimality by selecting even numbers guarantees a common factor of 2.
     - Checking if a fixed sum (when \(l = r\)) is composite.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Non-Coprime Subset Problems:** Where you must select or partition numbers to form groups with gcd \(>1\).
     - **Factorization Challenges:** Problems requiring determination of composite numbers.

2. **Handling Fixed Sum Constraints:**
   - **Concept:** When the sum \(a+b\) is fixed (i.e. \(l = r\)), the problem reduces to factorizing that sum.
   - **Usage in This Problem:**
     - Check if the fixed sum is composite; if so, a valid split can be constructed.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Partition Problems:** Splitting a number into parts that satisfy certain divisibility properties.
     - **Fixed Sum Combinatorics:** Problems where the total is constant and partitions are needed.

3. **Simple Construction via Even Numbers:**
   - **Concept:** Even numbers always share a factor of 2.
   - **Usage in This Problem:**
     - For \(l < r\), selecting two equal even numbers is a straightforward way to guarantee \(\gcd(a, b) \neq 1\).
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Equal Partitioning:** Problems requiring splitting an even number into two equal parts.
     - **Guaranteeing Common Factors:** Problems where ensuring a common factor is crucial.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  - In the worst-case (when \(l = r\)), the algorithm performs factor checking up to \(\sqrt{l}\), which is \(O(\sqrt{l})\).
  - Otherwise, the operations are \(O(1)\).
  - Given \(r \le 10^7\), the factor check is efficient.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - Constant extra space \(O(1)\), aside from input storage.
