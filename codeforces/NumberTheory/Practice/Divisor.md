## Problem Overview

You are given a shuffled list of integers which contains all the divisors of two unknown positive integers \( x \) and \( y \). Every divisor of \( x \) appears exactly once, and every divisor of \( y \) appears exactly once. However, if a number is a common divisor of both \( x \) and \( y \), it appears twice in the list.

Your task is to recover any valid pair \( (x, y) \) such that the merged list of their divisors (possibly in a different order) is exactly the given list.

**Example:**
If \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 6 \), the divisors are:
- Divisors of 4: \(\{1, 2, 4\}\)
- Divisors of 6: \(\{1, 2, 3, 6\}\)

The merged list (with common divisors appearing twice) is: \([1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6]\) (in any order).

## Input and Output Format

**Input:**
- The first line contains an integer \( n \) (\(2 \le n \le 128\)) â€” the number of numbers in the list.
- The second line contains \( n \) integers \( d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n \) (\(1 \le d_i \le 10^4\)), representing the divisors (with common divisors repeated).

**Output:**
- Print two positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that the merged list of their divisors is a permutation of the given list. It is guaranteed that an answer exists. If there are multiple answers, output any.

---

## Approach and Intuition

1. **Observation:**
   - The largest number in the list must be either \( x \) or \( y \) because both \( x \) and \( y \) are divisors of themselves.
   - Let \( \text{firstNum} \) be the maximum number from the list. Then, one of the unknowns is \( \text{firstNum} \).

2. **Determining the Second Number:**
   - The divisors of \( \text{firstNum} \) will appear in the list.
   - If we mark (or remove) one occurrence of every divisor of \( \text{firstNum} \) from the list, the largest remaining unmarked number is a candidate for the second number \( y \) (or \( x \) if \( \text{firstNum} \) is \( y \)).
   - The intuition is that common divisors appear twice, so after removing one copy of each divisor of the maximum number, the next largest number will be the other integer.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The list is small and bounds guarantee a solution exists.

## Core Concepts and Applications

1. **Divisor and Factorization Properties:**
   - **Concept:** Understanding divisors and how the maximum element in a divisor list relates to the original numbers.
   - **Usage in This Problem:**
     - The maximum element must be one of the two original numbers.
     - Removing one occurrence of each divisor of the maximum helps in identifying the second number.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Divisor-Related Problems:** Finding numbers given a set of divisors.
     - **Factorization Challenges:** Problems where reconstructing numbers from their factors is required.

2. **Set Data Structure for Deduplication:**
   - **Concept:** Using a set to track which divisors have been encountered.
   - **Usage in This Problem:**
     - Ensures each divisor of the maximum number is only marked once.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Distinct Element Counting:** Problems where duplicate handling is crucial.
     - **Set Intersection/Union Problems:** In which uniqueness is essential.

3. **Simple Greedy Construction:**
   - **Concept:** After determining one number, greedily pick the next highest candidate from the remaining elements.
   - **Usage in This Problem:**
     - The maximum unmarked number is chosen as the second number.
   - **Similar Problems:**
     - **Reconstruction Problems:** Where one must rebuild numbers from parts.
     - **Greedy Matching Problems:** That involve selecting candidates based on sorted order.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Scanning the list to find the maximum element: \( O(n) \).
  - Marking divisors using a set: \( O(n) \) (each insertion and lookup is \( O(1) \) on average).
  - Finding the maximum unmarked value: \( O(n) \).

  Overall: \( O(n) \).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - \( O(n) \) for storing the list of divisors.
  - \( O(n) \) for the set in the worst-case.
