## Problem Overview

You are given an array \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) of positive integers. Your task is to partition the array into \(k\) contiguous subsegments (with \(k > 1\)) such that the final score—defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sums of these subsegments—is maximized. In other words, you need to split the array into at least two parts, compute the sum of each part, and choose the partition that yields the maximum possible GCD of these sums.

**Example:**
For the array \([2, 2, 1, 3]\) and choosing \(k=2\), one valid partition is:
- Subsegment 1: \([2, 2]\) with sum \(4\)
- Subsegment 2: \([1, 3]\) with sum \(4\)

The score is \(\gcd(4, 4) = 4\).

---

## Input and Output Format

**Input:**
- The first line contains an integer \( t \) (\(1 \le t \le 10^4\)) — the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer \( n \) (\(2 \le n \le 2 \times 10^5\)) — the length of the array.
  - The second line contains \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) (\(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\)).

It is guaranteed that the sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

**Output:**
- For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible score (i.e., the maximum GCD of subsegment sums) for an optimal partition.

---

## Approach and Intuition

**Key Observation:**
- It turns out that splitting the array into exactly 2 subsegments (i.e., \(k = 2\)) is always optimal when maximizing the GCD of subsegment sums.
  - Let the total sum of the array be \(S\).
  - If you split the array into two parts at some index \(i\) (where \(1 \le i < n\)), let the prefix sum be \(P\) and the suffix sum be \(S-P\).
  - The score for that split is \(\gcd(P, S-P)\).

**Strategy:**
1. Compute the total sum \(S\) of the array.
2. Iterate over all possible splits (i.e., for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\)):
   - Maintain a running prefix sum \(P\).
   - Compute the GCD of \(P\) and \(S-P\).
   - Track the maximum GCD encountered.
3. Return the maximum GCD found.

**Why 2 subsegments?**
- With two segments, the score is \(\gcd(P, S-P)\), and any partition into more than two segments will have sums that are further divided, which does not yield a higher GCD than the optimal two-segment split.

## Core Concepts and Their Applications

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - **Concept:** GCD is used to determine the largest number that divides two numbers. Here, the goal is to maximize \(\gcd(P, S-P)\) where \(P\) is the prefix sum and \(S\) is the total sum.
   - **Applications:**
     - **GCD Partition Problems:** Splitting arrays or numbers to maximize or minimize the GCD.
     - **Number Theory Challenges:** Many competitive programming and interview problems involve the GCD, such as Euclid’s algorithm.

2. **Prefix Sum:**
   - **Concept:** Maintaining a running sum (prefix sum) allows efficient computation of the sum of any subarray.
   - **Applications:**
     - **Range Query Problems:** Such as computing the sum over a range quickly.
     - **Dynamic Programming on Arrays:** Problems that require cumulative sums.

3. **Greedy Partitioning:**
   - **Concept:** Splitting the array into exactly 2 subsegments can be optimal for maximizing the GCD. This is often a simplification that leverages the structure of the problem.
   - **Applications:**
     - **Partitioning Problems:** Where optimal partitions can be found by a greedy or iterative approach.
     - **Array Splitting Challenges:** Similar to "Divide the Array" problems that appear in contests.
