Below is the comprehensive summary file for the **MEX Repetition** problem, including detailed explanations, both Java and C++ solutions with clear comments, core concepts, complexity analysis, and a problem rating with justification.

## Problem Overview

You are given an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) of pairwise distinct integers taken from the range \( [0, n] \). An operation is defined as follows:
**For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) (in order), replace \( a_i \) with the MEX of the entire array.**
Recall that **MEX** (Minimum Excludant) of a collection of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the collection. For example, \( \text{MEX}(0,2,2,1,4) = 3 \) and \( \text{MEX}(1,2) = 0 \).

You are also given an integer \( k \). Your task is to perform the described operation \( k \) times (or, equivalently, compute the final array after \( k \) operations) and print the resulting array (of length \( n \)).

---

## Input and Output Format

**Input:**
- The first line contains an integer \( t \) (\(1 \le t \le 10^5\)) â€” the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of:
  - A line with two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (\(1 \le n \le 10^5\), \(1 \le k \le 10^9\)).
  - A line with \( n \) space-separated distinct integers \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) with \( 0 \le a_i \le n \).

It is guaranteed that the sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 10^5 \).

**Output:**
- For each test case, print the final array (of \( n \) integers) after performing \( k \) operations.

---

## Example

**Input:**
```
5
1 2
1
3 1
0 1 3
2 2
0 2
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
10 100
5 3 0 4 2 1 6 9 10 8
```

**Output:**
```
1
2 0 1
2 1
2 3 4 5 0
7 5 3 0 4 2 1 6 9 10
```

**Explanation:**
For the first test case:
- Start: \([1]\)
- Operation 1: MEX(\([1]\)) = 0, so array becomes \([0]\).
- Operation 2: MEX(\([0]\)) = 1, so array becomes \([1]\).

---

## Approach and Intuition

The key observation is that each operation replaces every element of the array with the current MEX of the array, and then the array is updated in a fixed cyclic manner.

**Step-by-Step Approach:**

1. **Extend the Array:**
   - Form a new state array of length \( n+1 \) by appending the current MEX (which is the smallest number missing from the set \(\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}\)) to the end of the current array.

2. **Cyclic Right Shift:**
   - Each operation effectively shifts the state array right by one position (cyclically) over the \( n+1 \) positions.
   - Therefore, after \( k \) operations, the final state array is obtained by a cyclic right shift of the initial state array by \( k \mod (n+1) \) positions.
   - The final output is the first \( n \) elements of this shifted array.

**Why does this work?**
- After one complete operation, every element becomes the MEX of the initial array. Adding that at the end and cyclically shifting simulates the process over multiple operations.

## Core Concepts and Applications

1. **MEX Calculation and Array Transformation:**
   - **Concept:** The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not in that set. In this problem, the MEX of the initial array is appended to it.
   - **Applications:** MEX is a common concept in competitive programming. It appears in problems such as "MEX Queries," "Game Theory (Nim)," and various combinatorial games.

2. **Cyclic Right Shift:**
   - **Concept:** A cyclic shift (or rotation) of an array rearranges the elements such that they wrap around. Here, each operation corresponds to a cyclic right shift.
   - **Applications:** This technique is used in string rotations, array manipulation problems, and scheduling problems.

3. **Efficient Modulo Arithmetic:**
   - **Concept:** Using modulo operation to calculate the effective number of shifts when the number of operations \( k \) can be very large.
   - **Applications:** Often used in problems dealing with periodicity, rotations, and cycles.

4. **Set Data Structure for MEX Computation:**
   - **Concept:** A set is used to efficiently determine the MEX by removing the elements present in the array.
   - **Applications:** Set-based MEX computation is common in problems involving missing elements or "first absent" queries.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Building the set and computing MEX: \( O(n \log n) \) (in worst-case due to set operations).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - \( O(n) \) for storing the array and auxiliary structures.

Given the constraints (total \( n \le 10^5 \)), the solution is efficient.
